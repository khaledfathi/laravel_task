Write a single page application

We expect you to use the MVC approach. We present you two ways to solve the problem:

- You can use any php framework (we know a bit of symfony and laravel) or plain php if you wish. You have to use some kind of sql service (mysql, sqlite) to store the data.
- Alternatively you can write the process of designing the database, backend and frontend in most detailed way. In this case plan the database of the chosen feature set, write a detailed description of the components of the app.

The application developed in three stages. You can target any stage but try to finish that for he deadline.

## Minimal feature set

- Every user is anonymous (no need to register or login).
- Visitors can submit a message.
- The message has
  - title,
  - text body,
  - timestamp,
  - optional parent message.
- Anyone can write new message.
- Anyone can attach new message to other messages.
- No editing.
- We should display the messages in reversed time order (newest first).

## Advanced features

- User registration and authentication.
- User roles (admins are authorized to hide or delete any messages).
- Admin user can edit users data.
- Users can EDIT any of their own messages.

## Pro features

- Messages can have attachments with file upload.
- Attached files can be downloaded via links below the message.
